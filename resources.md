I developed these learning modules to provide an introduction to data analysis and visualization in R. I taught these as part of Texas A&M University's 2022 Open Source for Open Sciene (OSOS) Workshop, a free, weekend-long event focused on providing new R users with hands-on experience with R through live-coding demos and interactive exercises.

These materials draw on the resources available from Data Carpentry, as well as an excellent [Intro to R](https://dshizuka.github.io/RCourse/) course taught by Dai Shizuka at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (that's where I learned R myself!).

I plan to add additional modules in the future, and I look forward to developing this into my own Intro to R course soon.

## Modules
