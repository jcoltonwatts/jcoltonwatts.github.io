## Background

While R provides ready-to-go tools for basic data visualization, it can quickly become cumbersome trying to customize these to more specific needs. The R package _ggplot2_ provides an alternative "grammar of graphics" that makes constructing high-quality, nuanced graphics a lot easier. At the same time, _ggplot2_ accomplishes this by adopting its own peculiar syntax and structure, so it takes a little getting used to. It's well worth it though, as I hope this module will show!

## Objectives

We really have one objective today: make a pretty plot! But we can break that down a bit:

  1. Install and load ggplot2
  2. Discuss basics of ggplot syntax
  3. Build a plot
  4. Save the graphic to a file
