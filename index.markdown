Welcome to my page.

I'm an evolutionary ecologist interested in how animal behavior shapes the responses of populations to the environmental conditions they experience. My research combines empirical methods and mathematical modeling to better understand the ultimate causes of behaviors and their consequences for evolutionary and ecological dynamics.

I study a variety of specific topics, from mate choice and sexual signaling to daily rhythms and life history strategies. I'm especially interested in how selection on mate choice and sexual signals changes with the social environment, and how adaptation (or lack thereof) to the social environment affects trait evolution and population persistence. As a postdoctoral researcher in the [Fitzpatrick Lab at Texas A&M University](https://fitzpatrickresearch.com/), I'm developing population genetic models to understand how benefits gained through social interactions contribute to the evolution of conspicuous signals. Check out my Research page for more details!
