Oh boy, here we go! This is my first attempt at creating and maintaining a site for my work as a biologist. I'm very new to the various tools I'm using to accomplish this, so please bear with me as I learn.

I'm looking forward to using this space for posting updates on my research and life in general. Stay tuned!
